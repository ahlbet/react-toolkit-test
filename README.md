## STEPS

- Clone Repo
- `npm install`
- Open second terminal window and make an empty project directory outside of the `react-toolkit` directory.
- run `node /path/to/react-toolkit-test/index.js`
- use CLI to choose which components to copy with `space` (navigate with up and down arrows)
- hit `enter`
- your project should now have a components directory with your chosen component files

NOTE: I just copied the entire `real-talk-web` components folder over for this example so obviously some of them do not make sense for the end product.

## TODO:

- add flexibility to handle the case where a components/ directory already exists within the project
